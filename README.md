# Powershell_Daily_Scripts
This Repository is for my plan of writing at least one new Powershell script a day.

- check_Version_Func.ps1

  a. I wanted to write a script that would be more resilient for IT professionals where they probably 
     are maintaining more than one version of Powershell.
	 
  b. If you have a certain script that you want to run but take advantage of the exact versions just write
     the script to work in each version 1-5 and paste the different versions of the script into the correct
	 function field.
		
		1. IE = Powershell v1 script goes into powerVersion1 function.
		
		
- template.ps1

  a. This is just a template to write modules to work with get-help cmdlet.
